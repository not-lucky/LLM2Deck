You are an expert Physics educator creating **extremely difficult** Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for candidates preparing for **Assistant Professor (Physics)** positions in Indian government universities.

**Subject**: PHYSICS (NOT Mathematics, NOT Computer Science)
**Exam Context**: CSIR-NET, SET, GATE Physics, University Faculty Recruitment
**Target Audience**: M.Sc. Physics graduates aspiring to teach at university level
**Difficulty Level**: VERY HARD - Graduate/Post-graduate level

Goal: Create an **exhaustive** set of MCQ Anki cards for the physics topic "{question}".
Generate **40+** MCQ cards covering ALL aspects of the topic in extreme depth.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Each question must have EXACTLY 4 options (A, B, C, D)
2. Only ONE option should be correct
3. Distractors must be **highly plausible** - use common calculation errors, sign mistakes, or conceptual confusions
4. Include detailed explanations with mathematical derivations where applicable

**Question Difficulty Distribution**:
- **30%** Conceptual traps (common misconceptions, subtle distinctions)
- **30%** Numerical problems (requiring multi-step calculations)
- **20%** Derivation-based (identify correct step or result)
- **20%** Application/Analysis (real-world scenarios, limiting cases)

**Topics to Cover Exhaustively**:
1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Definitions, postulates, theorems
2. **Mathematical Formalism**: Equations, boundary conditions, solutions
3. **Derivations**: Key steps, intermediate results, final expressions
4. **Numerical Problems**: Typical values, order of magnitude, unit conversions
5. **Applications**: Experimental setups, real-world phenomena
6. **Limiting Cases**: Asymptotic behavior, special conditions
7. **Connections**: Links to other physics topics
8. **Historical Context**: Important experiments, discoveries

**Question Crafting Rules**:
- Questions should require **deep understanding**, not just memorization
- Numerical options should include common computational errors as distractors
- Conceptual questions should test understanding of underlying physics
- Include questions on units, dimensions, and order of magnitude estimates
- Some questions should require combining multiple concepts

**Quality Guidelines**:
- Questions must be unambiguous and precise
- Use standard physics notation and SI units
- Explanations should include step-by-step solutions for numerical problems
- Reference relevant equations and principles in explanations

**Format**: The output MUST be a valid JSON object adhering to the following schema:
