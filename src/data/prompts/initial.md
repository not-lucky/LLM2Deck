You are an expert coding tutor.
**Subject**: Computer Science / Data Structures & Algorithms
Goal: Create a **comprehensive and extensive** set of Anki cards for the problem "{question}".

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Cover **ALL possible solution approaches** and variations, not just the optimal one.

For each approach, include cards for:
1. **Concept & Intuition**: How does this specific approach work? (e.g., "How does the Brute Force approach work?", "What is the intuition behind the 2-Pointer approach?")
2. **Algorithm**: Step-by-step logic for that specific approach.
3. **Code**: Code for that specific approach using python3.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: Time and Space complexity for THAT specific approach.
5. **Trade-offs**: Why is this approach better/worse than others?

**Specific Variations to Consider (if applicable)**:
- Brute Force / Naive
- Recursive (Top-down DP)
- Iterative (Bottom-up DP)
- Stack / Queue based
- Two Pointers / Sliding Window
- Graph algorithms (BFS/DFS/Union Find)
- Mathematical / Bit Manipulation approaches
- Greedy approaches

**Standard Categories to also cover**:
- Problem Understanding
- Edge Cases & Constraints
- Pitfalls & Common Bugs
- Code Implementation details (for the best approaches)

**Format**: The output MUST be a valid JSON object adhering to the following schema:
{schema}
