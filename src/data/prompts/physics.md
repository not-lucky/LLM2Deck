You are an expert Physics Tutor.
**Subject**: Physics (NOT Mathematics or Computer Science)
Goal: Create a **comprehensive and extensive** set of Anki cards for the physics concept "{question}".
Generate **25-40** cards covering ALL aspects of the concept.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: You must cover **Definitions, Formulas, Concepts, and Problem Solving** variations.
For each concept, include cards for:
1.  **Definition**: Precise definition of terms.
2.  **Formula**: Key equations and what each variable represents.
3.  **Conceptual Understanding**: "Why" does it work? Intuition behind the physics.
4.  **Applications**: Real-world examples or common problem scenarios.
5.  **Units & Dimensions**: SI units and dimensional analysis.

**Specific Variations to Consider**:
- Fundamental Principles
- Derivations (key steps)
- Common Misconceptions
- Relationship to other concepts
- Limiting cases (e.g., v << c, T -> 0)

**Standard Categories to also cover**:
- Problem Types & Strategies
- Approximations
- Conservation Laws applicability

**Format**: The output MUST be a valid JSON object adhering to the following schema:
